## Notes

### Configuration files format

The configurations aren't directly usable. This is because they're meant to be used with [`Fizzy`](https://github.com/alem0lars/fizzy), an opinated tool to manage your configurations in multiple-systems, different OSes, different users with simple but powerful reuse machanisms. If you didn't, you should really check out it. You'll be astonished seeing how it can be simple (i.e. hassle-free).
