# Configs

[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/alem0lars/configs.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](https://waffle.io/alem0lars/configs)

## Notes

### Configuration files format

The configurations aren't directly usable. This is because they're meant to be used with [`Fizzy`](https://github.com/alem0lars/fizzy), an opinated tool to manage your configurations in multiple-systems, different OSes, different users with simple but powerful reuse machanisms. If you didn't, you should really check out it. You'll be astonished seeing how it can be simple (i.e. hassle-free).

**Please notice that `master` branch should be kept empty** (except for [README.md](./README.md), [LICENSE](./LICENSE) and that kind of stuff..).

**We should move the other contents from `master` to `fizzy`.. See [this issue](https://github.com/alem0lars/configs/issues/2)**.
